# rem-v2
Well, this is the rewrite of rem, now even cleaner and hopefully with less bugs

##Requirements:
* Node and NPM
* Git
* MongoDB (follow instructions on how to configure the server at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
* (Windows) Build tools (can be installed from Npm using the commands npm install --global windows-build-tools)
* ffmpeg and youtube-dl

##Getting Started 
1. Download youtube-dl and ffmpeg and add both into the Windows path (Suggest puttiing both youtube-dl and ffmpeg into the same folder inside the C:\ to keep everything simple) 
2. clone the source of v2 from git, 
3. npm install inside the root of the rem-v2 folder 
4. create config folder in the root of the rem-v2 folder 
5. create and edit your configuration (has the same format as v1)

If you need help creating tokens and a Youtube api I suggest reading these two tutorials on it.
